# GeolocationSystemToFindNearestCar
This is a college Project that uses spatial index with quadtrees, in python, to find the nearest car to a users entered location.

This is a geographical location system that is made in python. It uses spatial indexing a quadtree in order to create a quick and efficient way to store all the locations of cars all over the world and give the user the five closest car to their location and let them pick from them. This Project simulates cars locations by a random seed generator so that is why some of the "cars" are out in the ocean. In the real world the locations would all be on land and would be derived from a satellite and the users location would also be derived from a satellite.
