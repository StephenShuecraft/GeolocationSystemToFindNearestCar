# GeolocationSystemToFindNearestCar<br />
This is a college Project that uses spatial index with quadtrees, in python, to find the nearest car to a users entered location.

This is a geographical location system that is made in python. It uses spatial indexing a quadtree in order to create a quick and efficient way to store all the locations of cars all over the world and give the user the five closest car to their location and let them pick from them. This Project simulates cars locations by a random seed generator so that is why some of the "cars" are out in the ocean. In the real world the locations would all be on land and would be derived from a satellite and the users location would also be derived from a satellite.

Below is an image that shows how to enter your location. After you enter your information you can press "Show Nearest Rides" or "Quit."

You can also select which car you would like to come get you and you are shown a menu of the vehicles and how far away you are from them. You then make your selection and click "Select."
